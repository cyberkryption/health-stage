You're welcome!

If you have the same sensor as I have lying around here, you have to attach the VCC (on the MQ-7) to the 5 volt pin on the RPi. The GND goes to ground, and the AOUT goes to the analogue-digital converter. The basic RPi uses the MCP3008 chip, I assume you have this chip as well? It is the same chip you need for other analogue sensors. If so, just remember the input you routed your MQ-7 to and add this code to the AirPi/sensors.cfg file on your RPi (Where adcpin should be the pin on the MCP3008):

[MQ-7]
filename=analogue
enabled=on
measurement=Carbon_Monoxide
adcPin=2
sensorName=MQ-7


This should automatically create a feed on Xively with the measured resistance.
